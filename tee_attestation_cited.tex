\subsection{TEE Attestation Support}

To ensure that a remote GLP agent is genuine—running the correct version of the GLP app within a secure execution environment—GLP relies on TEE-based attestation~\cite{googlePlayIntegrity,appleAppAttest,attestAsiaCCS23,safetynotMobiSys21}. Both major mobile platforms impose constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Android's Play Integrity and SafetyNet APIs, and Apple's App Attest, require challenge-response flows mediated by a backend.
    \item The verification of attestation responses, including decoding and signature checks, depends on server-side libraries provided by Google and Apple.
\end{itemize}

A GLP backend service is therefore required to generate fresh, request-bound challenges and verify attestation responses. The result—a signed assertion that a specific public key belongs to a verified GLP app instance—can then be shared with other agents. These services can be replicated, cached, and federated.
